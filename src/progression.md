# Progression

## Server moderator

At Neospring, we start everybody as a Discord server moderator. You land here immediately after having your application accepted.

This period is used to evaluate your performance and activity. At some point, you'll be considered for promotion to a site moderator after a little.

While Neospring is run by volunteers, we still need a probationary period to keep things safe! :)

## Site moderator

After being accepted as a site moderator, you're given basic helper[^1] permissions on Neospring.

As a site moderator, you're expected to review reports (through the site **and** through Discord tickets) as much as you can. Obviously, there's no obligation to go through and review reports all day, every day. We expect that you'll at least be able to at least glance over some everyday, though!

We know that starting out as a site moderator can be scary and even daunting, so that's why this guide exists to help you understand everything!

## Site manager

After a long period of being a basic site moderator, you'll be reviewed to become a manager. As a manager, you'll be given manager[^2] permissions.

As a site manager, you're granted many more permissions. You'll be able to review incoming site moderators, and you'll have the ability to promote helpers from applications. You're _not_ able to promote helpers to managers, as that can only be done by users with admin[^3] permissions.

A site manager is currently the highest position you can achieve.
