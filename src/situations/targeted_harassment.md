# Targeted harassment

Another very common moderation situation is a report about targeted harassment.

Neospring does not allow targeted harassment in **any way**[^1]. If you observe targeted harassment or are reviewing a report about it, you should first investigate _what_ is going on. Take note of any strong language, threats, racism, dogpiling, bullying, ad hominem attacks, or anything that could signal a targeted attack on an individual or a group.

Once you've identifed targeted harassment, we can start with a simple warning if the situation hasn't escalated yet. You should warn the person who is doing the harassment if possible.

If the attacks have already got to the point of threatening violence, doxxing, or anything of the like, you should immediately ban the harasser's account **and IP**. Harassment has no place on Neospring, so this person should not be given the chance to come back anonymously or on another account at all.

No appeals should be accepted for targeted harassment, as there is no way to explain that behaviour.
