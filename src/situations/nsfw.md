# NSFW content

Unsurprisingly, NSFW content is the most common material you'll have to moderate.

## Irregular NSFW content without a warning

In this situation, "irregular" means that the account doesn't post it regularly. If you are thinking irregular being something strange such as gore, you can just go ahead and ban the account.

If the account doesn't _usually_ post NSFW content, but has decided to once or twice, they should apply warning(s) and mark the response(s) as unlisted before posting them. This can be done through the "more response options" menu everywhere they can create a response/post.

If the user forgot to do this, the response should be promptly deleted and an account warning should be applied. Something like this:

> Please label NSFW responses with a warning and mark them as unlisted. If you plan to regularly post NSFW, feel free to just mark your account as NSFW instead. Neospring TOS: (3) Content.

As defined by the Rainbeam Staff Guide, this is a great warning[^1]! We always want to be sure to cite the terms of service somewhere in our warning.

If the user keeps doing it, ban their account and move on.

## NSFW content on public timelines

The Neospring terms of service explicitly state that **ALL** profiles which regularly post NSFW content _must_ be marked as NSFW through their account settings[^2].

Applying an NSFW label to an account automatically makes all of its posts not publish to the public timelines. This means that any account regularly posting NSFW which ends up on the public timelines doesn't have the NSFW account label applied.

To start, we would go and create an account warning for the user. Something like this should do:

> Please mark your account as NSFW if you're going to regularly post NSFW content. You can also manually apply warnings and mark responses as unlisted. Neospring TOS: (3) Content.

If the user failed to comply with this warning within a day, feel free to mark their account as banned and move on.
